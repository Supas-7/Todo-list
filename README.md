## 💻 How It Works

- Tasks are added with a name, date, and time.
- They are stored in a global array and saved to `localStorage`.
- The list is sorted by the closest due date/time.
- You can mark tasks as done, edit, or delete them anytime.
- Completed tasks can be cleared in bulk with one click.

## 🧠 Core Technologies

- HTML
- CSS (You can add your own styles for a better UI)
